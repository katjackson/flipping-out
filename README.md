## ALL THE PLOTS

This repository features my first ever attempt at plotting data. Each plot is based data from a coin flipping simulation.
---
#### Simulation 1
After running a coin-flip-simulation 2<sup>16</sup> times and recording the results at every exponential interval ( 2<sup>0</sup>,  2<sup>1</sup>,  2<sup>2</sup>, etc.).

##### Differences in HEADS and TAILS totals
The simple line graph on line 9 plots the differences in heads or tails tallies at each interval.

##### HEADS to TAIL ratio
The simple line graph on line 11 plots the ratios of heads to tails results at each interval.

##### HEADS to TAIL ratio LOGARITHMIC SCALE
The scatter plot on line 12 plots the ratio of heads to tails results at each interval with a logarithmic base.

##### Differences in HEADS and TAILS totals LOGARITHMIC SCALE
The scatter plot on line 13 plots the differences in heads or tails tallies at each interval with a logarithmic base.

##### Mean and Standard Deviation
The starry scatter plots on lines 16 and 17 show the mean and standard deviation with a logarithmic scale.

#### Simulation 2
I ran a trial of 100 flips 100,000 times and running a trial of 1,000 flips 100,000 times.

##### Histograms
Lines 20 and 22 offer pretty histograms for each trial (100 and 1,000). They look very similar, but the bigger one has a smaller range.

##### Box Plot
The final plot at line 23 shows that the larger simulation returned a smaller variance of data.
