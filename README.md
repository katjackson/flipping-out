## ALL THE PLOTS

This repository features my first ever attempt at plotting data. Each plot is based data from a coin flipping simulation.

### Simulation 1
---
After running a coin-flip-simulation 2<sup>16</sup> times and recording the results at every exponential interval ( 2<sup>0</sup>,  2<sup>1</sup>,  2<sup>2</sup>, etc.).

#### Differences in HEADS and TAILS totals
The simple line graph on line 9 plots the differences in heads or tails tallies at each interval.

#### HEADS to TAIL ratio
The simple line graph on line 11 plots the ratios of heads to tails results at each interval.

#### HEADS to TAIL ratio LOGARITHMIC SCALE
The scatter plot on line 12 plots the ratio of heads to tails results at each interval with a logarithmic base.

#### Differences in HEADS and TAILS totals LOGARITHMIC SCALE
The scatter plot on line 13 plots the differences in heads or tails tallies at each interval with a logarithmic base.
